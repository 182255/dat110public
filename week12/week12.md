### Project 3 - Weeks 12 and 13: 25/03 - 05/04

### DHT Cooperative Mirroring with Quorum-based consistency protocol

The project assumes that you have read and understood the following sections in the Distributed system book:
- Section 5.2 - Distributed hash tables (DHT) (Naming)
- Section 6.3 - Decentralized algorithm (Coordination)
- Section 7.5 - Quorum-based protocols (Consistency and Replication)

Therefore the project builds on exercise 7 - Chord Distributed Hash Table (https://github.com/selabhvl/dat110public/tree/master/week7/ChordDHT)

### Description of project
This implementation is based on synchronous communication by using the Java RMI remote procedure call (RPC)
The system works under these models and assumptions
- Our quorum-based protocol uses strict, sequential consistency model and replicated write protocol
- We assume no message loss during communications
- We assume that network is stable and there is no communication failure

A DHT can be used to build a cooperative mirroring peer-to-peer distributed system in which multiple providers of content cooperate to store and serve each othersâ€™ data.

The idea behind cooperative mirroring is that a node can replicate its content among other nodes in the p2p system. In the DHT implementation, this replication is done dynamically where nodes can be assigned a file if the hash value (keyid) of a replica of this file maps to the hash value (id) of the node by using the rule (id >= keyid).

We use a simple implementation where a node, once it has successfully joined a chord ring, distributes it file by multicasting the hash of the file name and the initial content to the ring. 
- Replicas are first created by calling createReplicaFiles(filename) in the FileManager.
- Next, replicas are distributed to the nodes in the ring by resolving the replica name from the contact node
- When a remote node is mapped to a replica, a remote rpc is invoked on createFileInNodeLocalDirectory(sendercontent, replicahashid) of the remote node. If successful, a replica file with the name - replicahashid and content - sendercontent are created in the remote node. 

A file can then be looked up by any client from any node in the ring (see the above fig). The resolution for a file starts from this node.

The current implementation of the project allows the simulation of chord ring in a single machine environment.
To use multi computer simulation requires two slight modifications. 
1. In the Node class constructor - change the setNodeIP to use the IP address of the machine (setNodeIP(InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostAddress())) instead of setNodeIP(nodename). 
2. In the Util class, use registry = LocateRegistry.getRegistry(ipaddress, StaticTracker.PORT) and comment out registry = LocateRegistry.getRegistry(StaticTracker.PORT);

When these changes are made, you can then start the chord project on different machines.


### ChordDHT Project organisation

##### no.hvl.dat110.rpc.interfaces
- ChordNodeInterface: The interface class where remote functions for each node are defined.
- MutexInterface: Interface for the quorum algorithm

##### no.hvl.dat110.node
- Node: implements the ChordNodeInterface with its attributes and methods. For example, a node has an IP address, an identifier (hash of the IP address), finger table list, key id list, and so on. In addition, a node can be called to lookup any key id. Therefore, the method findSuccessor(keyid) and findHighestPredecessor(keyid) are directly implemented in node. In addition, the predecessor P of the successor S of node N can be notified that it has a new predecessor N, if P is between N and S after a remote call. This is implemented as P.notifySuccessor(N) and it's usually called during stabilize ring operation.
- Message: This is used to store the message we want to send among the nodes. It is also used to send back acknowledgements to the sender process. 
- Operations: The class handles the actual read and write requests and operations from the client processes.
- OperationType: An enum where the read and write types are defined

- NodeInformation: used to print out information about the status of the node (IP, ID, finger table entries, current keys)

##### no.hvl.dat110.node.client.test
- Various unit-tests 

##### no.hvl.dat110.chordoperations
This package contains five classes responsible for specific chord protocols: 
- see: https://github.com/selabhvl/dat110public/tree/master/week7/ChordDHT
- LeaveRing: runs periodically until the specified ttl after which the node leaves the ring and or it continues forever if loopforever = true

##### no.hvl.dat110.file
- FileManager: contains methods for creating replicas of a file, distributing those replicas among active nodes in the chord ring, and looking up the active nodes responsible for a given file by iteratively resolving the replicaid (hash of replica) from an active node.
The FileManager currently runs periodically by each chord node to allow dynamic distribute of files to new nodes that just joined the ring. 

##### no.hvl.dat110.rpc
- ChordNodeContainer: This is the 'server' for the node where the registry is started and where the binding of the remote stub object for the Node is done. In addition, all periodic chord operations are started in this class currently.

- StaticTracker: class that defines the ip addresses of possible active nodes in a ring. In addition, the port for the registry is specified in this class and the number of times a file should be replicated

##### no.hvl.dat110.util
- Hash: implements hash function method and converts the hash value to big integer. Also, it implements a custom modulo 2^mbit function for testing purposes (where mbit = 4). The current implementation uses SHA-1 which is a 128bit hash algorithm.
- Util: contains various utility methods for obtaining registry or performing conversion.

### Running the ChordDHT system

The ChordDHT is provided to you as a complete system that allows you to test reading and writing of requests from any client and to also test the quorum-based consistency protocol. Warning! You'll get many messages in the console when you run each chordNode, you may remove them in the code. 
- In addition, you can create a jar file for each process (1-10) where the main-class is                                                                                                                                           specified as the name of the process. This allows you to launch the chord nodes from an external terminal and provides the flexibility to view only the results of your unit-tests in the IDE. You can use the chord.sh located here: https://github.com/selabhvl/dat110public/blob/master/week12/chordjars/chord.sh for this purpose. 
- When you have generated the jar files, run each jar file e.g. $ java -jar chorddht1.jar in a separate terminal. (Note chorddht1.jar must be started first) 
- If you want to use multiple machines, then make the changes mentioned at the beginning, specify one valid IP address (multi-machine setup) in the StaticTracker class (This process class is expected to be started first to create the ring). Recompile using ChordNodeContainer as the Main Class in the manifest file and generate a new single jar file. Distribute this jar file among the group members.
On the IDE:
- Run the first ChordNodeContainer class (e.g. process1)
- Several ChordNodeContainer instances can then be launched. Each must specify addresses of at least one active ChordNodeContainer that is running currently in their StaticTracker class (e.g. "process1", "process2", etc.)

**Testing that the chord ring works**
Run the NodeClient class to test that a client can contact an active node and request for a file by resolving the file through the contacted node.



### QuorumAlgorithm project organisation

This project implements the quorum-based protocol. The project uses synchronous rpc communication among the processes. The quorum protocol is a replicated-write protocol where processes vote to gain write or read permission to a replicated resource. Assume a file is replicated N times and distributed on N servers, a process that wants to write to a replica file needs to assemble a write quorum (i.e. majority of N servers must give permission). The same process is observed for a read operation.

To prevent read-write and write-write conflicts, the voting algorithm must fulfil two constraints:

- Gifford's method:
1. Nr + Nw > N (prevents read-write conflicts)
2. Nw > N/2  (prevents write-write conflicts)

- A simpler method:
1. Nr = N/2 + 1
2. Nw = N/2 + 1
- This method also prevents both conflicts since each time, a quorum for write or read requires the majority votes (i.e. > N/2). 
 
The implementation should use the simple method. You are provided with the template and code skeleton that helps to reason about the implementation and allows you to test if it works. 

##### no.hvl.dat110.mutexprocess
- MutexProcess: The process that receives read/write request and implements mutual exclusion and consistency protocols.
- ProcessContainer: The 'server' for the MutexProcess
- Message: This is used to store the message we want to send among the nodes. It is also used to send back acknowledgements to the sender process. 
- Operations: The class handles the actual read and write requests and operations from the client processes.
- OperationType: An enum where the read and write types are defined
- Config: where PORT number is configured

##### no.hvl.dat110.interfaces
- ProcessInterface: Interface class mostly with methods for remote invocation.
- OperationType: An enum where the read and write types are defined

##### no.hvl.dat110.util
- Util: contains various utility methods for obtaining registry or performing conversion. Can be used to get the replica processes.

##### no.hvl.dat110.clients.test
- Unit test files to test quorum-based protocols using 10 communicating processes. 

### Organisation

The project will be carried out in weeks 12 and 13. You can form small **groups of 2-3 students**. Discussions among the groups are allowed, but the code handed in by the group should be the work of the group members - and not members of other groups.
Submission of your code should follow previous formats on canvas.

### Getting Started

You should start by cloning the Java code which can be found in the github repository.

https://github.com/selabhvl/dat110-project3-startcode.git

which contains an Eclipse-project for both the ChordDHT and Quorum protocol with start-code. In addition, it also contains a number of unit tests which can be used for testing the implemented functionalities. The unit-tests should not be modified/removed as they will be used for evaluation of the submitted solution.

In order for the group to use their own git-repository for further work on the codebase, one member of the group must create an empty repository on github/bitbucket without a README file and without a `.gitignore` file, and then perform the following operations

`git remote remove origin`

`git remote add origin <url-to-new-empty-repository>`

`git push -u origin master`

The other group members can now clone this new repository and work with a shared repository as usual.


There are three major tasks that you will implement in this project:


#### Task 1 - implement a quorum-based consistency protocol

You should use the QuorumAlgorithm template to implement the algorithm correctly. 
- Implement a quorum-based consistency protocol on the template provided. 
- Implement the missing parts in the template (MutexProcess)
- Use the Unit tests provided to test the correctness of your implementation


#### Task 2 - Integrate the Quorum algorithm into the ChordDHT

- Integrate the quorum-based implementation with the chord system. The ideal situation is that a node has a lock each for the files/resources that it is managing. However, for simplicity sake, the current implementation assumes one lock for all the resources being held by a node. It means that a node can only participate in one voting process.

- To do the integration, you would need to use the MutexInterface which has already been integrated.
- Your task, would then be to fill in the implementations in the missing methods
- Note that if your previous  implementation of quorum works correctly, it should not be very hard to transfer to the chordDHT (Node) process. Both are very similar.
- Use the unit tests to verify that you have correctly integrated the quorum protocol with ChordDHT


#### Task 3 - Implement Read and Write clients for the DHT
Your task here is to implement clients that can send a read or write request to the chord ring by contacting any of the active nodes.
- Three classes need to be modified
1. FileManager: Implement requestActiveNodesForFile, requestToReadFileFromAnyActiveNode, and requestWriteToFileFromAnyActiveNode methods
2. NodeClientReader: Implement the sendRequest() method
3. NodeClientWriter: Implement the sendRequest() method
- A client would first contact an active node in the ring
- Send the filename with the request
- The FileManager generates keyids for the file replicas and resolve each replica from the contacted node.
- Result is a list of active nodes that have the replicas in their filekey list.
- The client decide which node to contact and retrieve the file
- Use the NodeClientTester and NodeClient as inspiration
- Test your implementations using the unit tests provided with the chord project.
